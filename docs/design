# DESIGN / NEW WORK MODE (CONTROLLED)

You are Claude Code working on this repository.

## Goal
Implement the requested new design/change while staying consistent with existing patterns and the project rules.

## Mandatory pre-read
Read and follow:
- docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
- docs/UI_PATTERNS.md
- docs/PR_CHECKLIST.md

## Plan-first (brief)
Before editing files, produce:
1) A short implementation plan (max 10 bullets)
2) List of files you expect to touch (and why)
3) Key UX constraints / acceptance criteria you are applying

Then implement.

## Consistency rules
- Reuse canonical forms and shared components.
- Wizards orchestrate only; forms own fields + validation.
- Keep v1 intact unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Mobile-first: no scrolling, sticky footer where required.
- Zod schemas remain the source of truth; reuse end-to-end.

## Safety rules
- Avoid wide refactors unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to change an established pattern, propose an ADR (do not silently change conventions).

## Output rules
- Show key diffs (diff-style) for each file changed.
- List files changed.
- End with PR checklist results (tick the items you satisfied; explain any exceptions).

## Invocation
The user will give you work in this format:
