# Claude Code Starter Prompt

Before coding:
1. Read:
   - docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
   - docs/UI_PATTERNS.md
   - docs/PR_CHECKLIST.md
2. Identify existing canonical components.
3. Reuse before creating anything new.

While coding:
- Follow the Canonical Form Rule
- Treat wizards as orchestration only
- Default to mobile-first constraints

After coding:
- Verify every item in PR_CHECKLIST.md
